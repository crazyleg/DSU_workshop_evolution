# DSU_workshop_evolution
Repo for DSU workshop 2019, Evolutionary algorithms 

1. Use python virtual env of your choice, I prefer miniconda. ```conda create -n dsu_workshop python=3.7```
2. Install requirements.txt with pip or conda ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Try to run sanity_check.ipynb to make sure that all stuff works. Likely some extra system-wide libs like ffmpeg would be required. Install them

#### --- Extras for the bravehearted 
4. Get a free trial of MuJoCo https://www.roboti.us/license.html . Install mujoco-py.
