# DSU_workshop_evolution
Repo for DSU workshop 2019, Evolutionary algorithms 

1. Use python virtual env of your choice, I prefer miniconda. ```conda create -n dsu_workshop python=3.7```
2. Install requirements.txt with pip or conda ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Run test.ipynb to make sure that all stuff works. Likely you will have to install some extra system-wide libraries, like ffmpeg. Take your time and find appropriate package for your OS. 

#### Extras for the bravehearted 
4. Get a free trial of MuJoCo https://www.roboti.us/license.html . Install mujoco-py.
